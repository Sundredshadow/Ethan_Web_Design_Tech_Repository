## CyberStrike

### I.HighConcept
A small, intense, story driven, game focused on cyber security and 

hacking. Uses actual hacking principals, as the primary game mechanic, 

alongside fun game modes and content 
### II.Genre
-Puzzle 
-Educational 
-Story Driven
### III.Platform
Desktop (to start with maybe mobile)
### IV.Story
The story will focus on actual hacking scenarios that are applicable to the average person.

Will have the player act as the hacker, or act as sys admin or defender. It will also have 
 
additional mechanics that hopefully will push it beyond just a text based game, with actual 
 
gameplay, intertwined with the storyline and the pseudo-hacking/security.
### V.Esthetics
Graphics: Pixel/2D; 8bit-32bit not sure; will mimic certain applications like command prompt.
### VI.Gameplay
Since this is a game that integrates cyber security principals, with regular gameplay, it

will have things like command prompt, port scanning, and VM ware, (all fake of course)
 
integrated alongside more traditional gameplay. This gameplay may include small hacking 
  
related minigames, or a small 2D world to explore with a small story. Also, since the 
  
primary focus of this game is cyber security, the player will face the moral/ethical
  
questions involved in such a field, which, ideally, will influence later actions within 
   
the game.
### VII.Screenshots

### VIII.Other
Other: May try to implement a slightly more complex engine for the game so I can do more of

what I want to do. There is an implementation of webgl for monogame, am going to look into 
 
it since I am experienced more with monogame and C# than I am with javascript.
