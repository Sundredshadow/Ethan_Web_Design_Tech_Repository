###INFO:

Features
####CopyURL and Favorite on each gif
*CopyURL copies to clipboard
*Favorite copies gif to aside underneath giphy title(note uses smaller version of gif)
####Reformatted css
*The title, favorites, and the search bar are sticky and thus won't leave the screen
*Images are justified by center and grabbed by use of the giphy api fixed_height_downsampled to keep images in-line with one another and a decent size
*Buttons are redone using a gradient generator https://angrytools.com/gradient/
